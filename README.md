Cosmotech samples and documentation for Microsoft Bonsai AI training

Samples:
* inventory management: a simple demonstration simulator of a supply chain with two retailers, one supplier, a central distribution hub and two ordering modes: direct for fast shipping by plane, and indirect by train and trucks through a distribution hub.  The brain learns how much to order fpr each inventory and each transport mode in order to maximize profit under an uncertain and volatile demand; several training options are possible, such as respect of storage constraints or seek a minimum service level while maximizing profit.
